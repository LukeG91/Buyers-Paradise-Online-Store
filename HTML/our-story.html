            <h4 class="our_story"><em>Our Story</em></h4>

            <p>We are a group of friends who have a passion for fashion and designer clothing items. We have been
                friends for over 20 years and we decided in January on 2018 to open an online store selling brands and
                clothing items that we love.</p> <br>

            <p>We were apprehensive in the beggining as there are many online stores out there and some major
                competition. Our passion and love for designer clothing helped us to overcome these fears and as a group
                we deicded to pursue our idea of selling clothing online.</p> <br>

            <p>We have been going for just over 2 years now and we have grown tremendously in that time. Our
                customers love our products and we love being able to provide our customers with top quality, high
                fashion desinger clothes and shoes.</p>

            <h4 class="howWeStarted"><em>How we started</em></h4>

            <p>We were sitting around a table at University one afternoon having lunch and we were looking at clothing
                items for sale online on our cell phones and one of our friends at the table, Nick said "wouldn't it be
                awesome to be able to have our own store and be able to supply the shoes and clothing items that we love
                to
                our customers."</p> <br>

            <p>That sentence spoken by Nick turned into a reality 2 months later. After many nights of discussions and
                brainstorming we decided to reach out to potenital suppliers and soon realised that we were able to
                provide the shoes and clothing items that we wanted to.</p> <br>

            <p>I(Luke) have a passion for coding and decided to teach myself how to code in order to be able to build
                our
                online store. I spent a month studying day and night and I was able to have our site up and running in
                just over 4 weeks. I am very proud to announce that our online store now gets updated regularly with new
                stock items as the demand for the products we sell is very high and we are so grateful to our customers
                for being so loyal to our brand.</p> <br>
